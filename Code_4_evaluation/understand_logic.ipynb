    "Also known as time series cross-validation or walk-forward validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows for better evaluation of how the model performs in realistic, evolving scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful when future data points become available over time, and you want to continuously update forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "Start with an initial training window (e.g., time points 1 to 100).\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecast the next period (e.g., point 101).\n",
    "\n",
    "Roll the origin forward (e.g., now train on 1 to 101, forecast 102), or slide the window if using a fixed-size training set.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics of the Order-Up-To Policy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Periodic Review:** Inventory levels are assessed at regular, fixed intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variable Order Quantities:** The quantity ordered varies based on current inventory levels and the target order-up-to level. Specifically, the order quantity equals the difference between the target level and the current inventory position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Target Level Determination:** The order-up-to level is typically calculated considering factors such as expected demand during the review period, lead time, and safety stock to buffer against demand variability.\n",

    "- \\( I \\) = Current inventory level at the time of review\n",

    "## Safety stock and target service level\n",
    "Safety stock is the buffer inventory kept to protect against uncertainties in demand and/or lead time.\n",
